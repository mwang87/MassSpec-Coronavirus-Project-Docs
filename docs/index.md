# Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Coronavirus Data

In the current global pandemic, we wanted make available mass spectrometry based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus data. 

You can find analyses and data for [proteomics](proteomics.md) and [metabolomics](metabolomics.md). 

## Contributing Data

To add your own data, we recommend you upload your datasets to a mass spectrometry repository. The following are great resources:

1. [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp) - For Proteomics/Metabolomics Data
1. [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) - For Proteomics Data
1. [Metabolights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) - For Metabolomics Data

We highly encourage you deposit along with it sample metadata, this includes experimental design and sample conditions (e.g. case vs control). 

Other coronavirus related datasets can be found [here](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/corona-mass-kb-datasets.jsp#%7B%22query%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22table_sort_history%22%3A%22createdMillis_dsc%22%2C%22keywords_input%22%3A%22CoronaMassKB%22%7D).

## Contributing Analyses
